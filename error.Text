11.1. Common problems
If two LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC runs do not produce the same answer on different machines or different numbers of processors, this is typically not a bug. In theory you should get identical answers on any number of processors and on any machine. In practice, numerical round-off can cause slight differences and eventual divergence of molecular dynamics phase space trajectories within a few 100s or few 1000s of timesteps. However, the statistical properties of the two runs (e.g. average energy or temperature) should still be the same.

If the velocity command is used to set initial atom velocities, a particular atom can be assigned a different velocity when the problem is run on a different number of processors or on different machines. If this happens, the phase space trajectories of the two simulations will rapidly diverge. See the discussion of the loop option in the velocity command for details and options that avoid this issue.

Similarly, the create_atoms command generates a lattice of atoms. For the same physical system, the ordering and numbering of atoms by atom ID may be different depending on the number of processors.

Some commands use random number generators which may be setup to produce different random number streams on each processor and hence will produce different effects when run on different numbers of processors. A commonly-used example is the fix langevin command for thermostatting.

A LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC simulation typically has two stages, setup and run. Most LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC errors are detected at setup time; others like a bond stretching too far may not occur until the middle of a run.

LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC tries to flag errors and print informative error messages so you can fix the problem. Of course, LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC cannot figure out your physics or numerical mistakes, like choosing too big a timestep, specifying erroneous force field coefficients, or putting 2 atoms on top of each other! If you run into errors that LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC doesn’t catch that you think it should flag, please send an email to the developers.

If you get an error message about an invalid command in your input script, you can determine what command is causing the problem by looking in the log.lammps file or using the echo command to see it on the screen. For a given command, LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC expects certain arguments in a specified order. If you mess this up, LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC will often flag the error, but it may read a bogus argument and assign a value that is valid, but not what you wanted. E.g. trying to read the string “abc” as an integer value and assigning the associated variable a value of 0.

Generally, LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC will print a message to the screen and logfile and exit gracefully when it encounters a fatal error. Sometimes it will print a WARNING to the screen and logfile and continue on; you can decide if the WARNING is important or not. A WARNING message that is generated in the middle of a run is only printed to the screen, not to the logfile, to avoid cluttering up thermodynamic output. If LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC crashes or hangs without spitting out an error message first then it could be a bug (see this section) or one of the following cases:

LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC runs in the available memory a processor allows to be allocated. Most reasonable MD runs are compute limited, not memory limited, so this shouldn’t be a bottleneck on most platforms. Almost all large memory allocations in the code are done via C-style malloc’s which will generate an error message if you run out of memory. Smaller chunks of memory are allocated via C++ “new” statements. If you are unlucky you could run out of memory just when one of these small requests is made, in which case the code will crash or hang (in parallel), since LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC doesn’t trap on those errors.

Illegal arithmetic can cause LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC to run slow or crash. This is typically due to invalid physics and numerics that your simulation is computing. If you see wild thermodynamic values or NaN values in your LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC output, something is wrong with your simulation. If you suspect this is happening, it is a good idea to print out thermodynamic info frequently (e.g. every timestep) via the thermo so you can monitor what is happening. Visualizing the atom movement is also a good idea to insure your model is behaving as you expect.

In parallel, one way LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC can hang is due to how different MPI implementations handle buffering of messages. If the code hangs without an error message, it may be that you need to specify an MPI setting or two (usually via an environment variable) to enable buffering or boost the sizes of messages that can be buffered.

11.2. Reporting bugs
If you are confident that you have found a bug in LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC, follow these steps.

Check the New features and bug fixes section of the LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC WWW site to see if the bug has already been reported or fixed or the Unfixed bug to see if a fix is pending.

Check the forums to see if it has been discussed before.

If not, please post a bug report describing the problem with any ideas you have as to what is causing it or where in the code the problem might be. The developers will ask for more info if needed, such as an input script or data files.

The most useful thing you can do to help us fix the bug is to isolate the problem. Run it on the smallest number of particles and fewest number of processors and with the simplest input script that reproduces the bug and try to identify what command or combination of commands is causing the problem.

Respectively the LAMMPS bug sections bug, unfixed bug and the mailing list

can be checked.
11.3. Error & warning messages
These are two alphabetic lists of the ERROR and WARNING messages LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC prints out and the reason why. If the explanation here is not sufficient, the documentation for the offending command may help. Error and warning messages also list the source file and line number where the error was generated. For example, this message

ERROR: Illegal velocity command (velocity.cpp:78)

means that line #78 in the file src/velocity.cpp generated the error. Looking in the source code may help you figure out what went wrong.

Note that error messages from user-contributed packages are not listed here. If such an error occurs and is not self-explanatory, you’ll need to look in the source code or contact the author of the package.

11.4. Errors:
1-3 bond count is inconsistent
An inconsistency was detected when computing the number of 1-3 neighbors for each atom. This likely means something is wrong with the bond topologies you have defined.
1-4 bond count is inconsistent
An inconsistency was detected when computing the number of 1-4 neighbors for each atom. This likely means something is wrong with the bond topologies you have defined.
Accelerator sharing is not currently supported on system

All mol IDs should be set for fix gcmc group atoms
The molecule flag is on, yet not all molecule ids in the fix group have been set to non-zero positive values by the user. This is an error since all atoms in the fix gcmc group are eligible for deletion, rotation, and translation and therefore must have valid molecule ids.
All pair coeffs are not set
All pair coefficients must be set in the data file or by the pair_coeff command before running a simulation.
All read_dump x,y,z fields must be specified for scaled, triclinic coords
For triclinic boxes and scaled coordinates you must specify all 3 of the x,y,z fields, else LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC cannot reconstruct the unscaled coordinates.

Did not find all elements in MEAM library file
The requested elements were not found in the MEAM file.
Did not find fix shake partner info
Could not find bond partners implied by fix shake command. This error can be triggered if the delete_bonds command was used before fix shake, and it removed bonds without resetting the 1-2, 1-3, 1-4 weighting list via the special keyword.

Out of range atoms - cannot compute MSM
One or more atoms are attempting to map their charge to a MSM grid point that is not owned by a processor. This is likely for one of two reasons, both of them bad. First, it may mean that an atom near the boundary of a processor’s sub-domain has moved more than 1/2 the neighbor skin distance without neighbor lists being rebuilt and atoms being migrated to new processors. This also means you may be missing pairwise interactions that need to be computed. The solution is to change the re-neighboring criteria via the neigh_modify command. The safest settings are “delay 0 every 1 check yes”. Second, it may mean that an atom has moved far outside a processor’s sub-domain or even the entire simulation box. This indicates bad physics, e.g. due to highly overlapping atoms, too large a timestep, etc.

This is a restriction because LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC can be confused about which image of an atom in the bonded interaction is the correct one to use. “Extent” in this context means the maximum end-to-end length of the bond/angle/dihedral. LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC computes this by taking the maximum bond length, multiplying by the number of bonds in the interaction (e.g. 3 for a dihedral) and adding a small amount of stretch.
Both groups in compute group/group have a net charge; the Kspace boundary correction to energy will be non-zero

The group defined by the temperature compute does not encompass all the atoms in one or more rigid bodies, so the change in degrees-of-freedom for the atoms in those partial rigid bodies will not be accounted for.
Created bonds will not create angles, dihedrals, or impropers
See the doc page for fix bond/create for more info on this restriction.
Dihedral problem: %d %ld %d %d %d %d
Conformation of the 4 listed dihedral atoms is extreme; you may want to check your simulation geometry.
Dump dcd/xtc timestamp may be wrong with fix dt/reset
If the fix changes the timestep, the dump dcd file will not reflect the change.
Ewald/disp Newton solver failed, using old method to estimate g_ewald
Self-explanatory.
FENE bond too long: %ld %d %d %g
A FENE bond has stretched dangerously far. It’s interaction strength will be truncated to attempt to prevent the bond from blowing up.
FENE bond too long: %ld %g
A FENE bond has stretched dangerously far. It’s interaction strength will be truncated to attempt to prevent the bond from blowing up.
Fix SRD walls overlap but fix srd overlap not set
You likely want to set this in your input script.
Fix bond/swap will ignore defined angles
See the doc page for fix bond/swap for more info on this restriction.
Fix evaporate may delete atom with non-zero molecule ID
This is probably an error, since you should not delete only one atom of a molecule.
Fix move does not update angular momentum
Atoms store this quantity, but fix move does not (yet) update it.
Fix move does not update quaternions
Atoms store this quantity, but fix move does not (yet) update it.
Fix recenter should come after all other integration fixes
Other fixes may change the position of the center-of-mass, so fix recenter should come last.
Fix shake with rRESPA computes invalid pressures
This is a known bug in LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC that has not yet been fixed. If you use SHAKE with rRESPA and perform a constant volume simulation (e.g. using fix npt) this only affects the output pressure, not the dynamics of the simulation. If you use SHAKE with rRESPA and perform a constant pressure simulation (e.g. using fix npt) then you will be equilibrating to the wrong volume.
Fix srd SRD moves may trigger frequent reneighboring
This is because the SRD particles may move long distances.
Fix srd grid size > 1/4 of big particle diameter
This may cause accuracy problems.
Fix srd particle moved outside valid domain
This may indicate a problem with your simulation parameters.
Fix srd particles may move > big particle diameter
This may cause accuracy problems.
Fix srd viscosity < 0.0 due to low SRD density
This may cause accuracy problems.
Fix thermal/conductivity comes before fix ave/spatial
The order of these 2 fixes in your input script is such that fix thermal/conductivity comes first. If you are using fix ave/spatial to measure the temperature profile induced by fix viscosity, then this may cause a glitch in the profile since you are averaging immediately after swaps have occurred. Flipping the order of the 2 fixes typically helps.
Fix viscosity comes before fix ave/spatial
The order of these 2 fixes in your input script is such that fix viscosity comes first. If you are using fix ave/spatial to measure the velocity profile induced by fix viscosity, then this may cause a glitch in the profile since you are averaging immediately after swaps have occurred. Flipping the order of the 2 fixes typically helps.
For better accuracy use ‘pair_modify table 0’
The user-specified force accuracy cannot be achieved unless the table feature is disabled by using ‘pair_modify table 0’.
Geometric mixing assumed for 1/r^6 coefficients
Self-explanatory.
Group for fix_modify temp != fix group
The fix_modify command is specifying a temperature computation that computes a temperature on a different group of atoms than the fix itself operates on. This is probably not what you want to do.
Improper problem: %d %ld %d %d %d %d
Conformation of the 4 listed improper atoms is extreme; you may want to check your simulation geometry.
Inconsistent image flags
The image flags for a pair on bonded atoms appear to be inconsistent. Inconsistent means that when the coordinates of the two atoms are unwrapped using the image flags, the two atoms are far apart. Specifically they are further apart than half a periodic box length. Or they are more than a box length apart in a non-periodic dimension. This is usually due to the initial data file not having correct image flags for the 2 atoms in a bond that straddles a periodic boundary. They should be different by 1 in that case. This is a warning because inconsistent image flags will not cause problems for dynamics or most LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC simulations. However they can cause problems when such atoms are used with the fix rigid or replicate commands.

Self-explanatory.
Kspace_modify slab param < 2.0 may cause unphysical behavior
The kspace_modify slab parameter should be larger to insure periodic grids padded with empty space do not overlap.
Less insertions than requested
Less atom insertions occurred on this timestep due to the fix pour command than were scheduled. This is probably because there were too many overlaps detected.
Library error in lammps_gather_atoms
This library function cannot be used if atom IDs are not defined or are not consecutively numbered.
Library error in lammps_scatter_atoms
This library function cannot be used if atom IDs are not defined or are not consecutively numbered, or if no atom map is defined. See the atom_modify command for details about atom maps.
Lost atoms via change_box: original %ld current %ld
The command options you have used caused atoms to be lost.
Lost atoms via displace_atoms: original %ld current %ld
The command options you have used caused atoms to be lost.
Lost atoms: original %ld current %ld
Lost atoms are checked for each time thermo output is done. See the thermo_modify lost command for options. Lost atoms usually indicate bad dynamics, e.g. atoms have been blown far out of the simulation box, or moved futher than one processor’s sub-domain away before reneighboring.
MSM mesh too small, increasing to 2 points in each direction
Self-explanatory.
Mismatch between velocity and compute groups
The temperature computation used by the velocity command will not be on the same group of atoms that velocities are being set for.

More than one fix rigid
It is not efficient to use fix rigid more than once.
Neighbor exclusions used with KSpace solver may give inconsistent Coulombic energies
This is because excluding specific pair interactions also excludes them from long-range interactions which may not be the desired effect. The special_bonds command handles this consistently by insuring excluded (or weighted) 1-2, 1-3, 1-4 interactions are treated consistently by both the short-range pair style and the long-range solver. This is not done for exclusions of charged atom pairs via the neigh_modify exclude command.
New thermo_style command, previous thermo_modify settings will be lost
If a thermo_style command is used after a thermo_modify command, the settings changed by the thermo_modify command will be reset to their default values. This is because the thermo_modify commmand acts on the currently defined thermo style, and a thermo_style command creates a new style.
No Kspace calculation with verlet/split
The 2nd partition performs a kspace calculation so the kspace_style command must be used.
No fixes defined, atoms won’t move
If you are not using a fix like nve, nvt, npt then atom velocities and coordinates will not be updated during timestepping.
No joints between rigid bodies, use fix rigid instead
The bodies defined by fix poems are not connected by joints. POEMS will integrate the body motion, but it would be more efficient to use fix rigid.
Not using real units with pair reax
This is most likely an error, unless you have created your own ReaxFF parameter file in a different set of units.
Number of MSM mesh points increased to be a multiple of 2
MSM requires that the number of grid points in each direction be a multiple of two and the number of grid points in one or more directions have been adjusted to meet this requirement.
OMP_NUM_THREADS environment is not set.
This environment variable must be set appropriately to use the USER-OMP pacakge.
One or more atoms are time integrated more than once
This is probably an error since you typically do not want to advance the positions or velocities of an atom more than once per timestep.
One or more compute molecules has atoms not in group
The group used in a compute command that operates on moleclues does not include all the atoms in some molecules. This is probably not what you want.
One or more respa levels compute no forces
This is computationally inefficient.

Particle deposition was unsuccessful
The fix deposit command was not able to insert as many atoms as needed. The requested volume fraction may be too high, or other atoms may be in the insertion region.
Reducing PPPM order b/c stencil extends beyond nearest neighbor processor
This may lead to a larger grid than desired. See the kspace_modify overlap command to prevent changing of the PPPM order.

This may lead to a larger grid than desired. See the kspace_modify overlap command to prevent changing of the PPPM order.
Reducing PPPMDisp Dispersion order b/c stencil extends beyond neighbor processor
This may lead to a larger grid than desired. See the kspace_modify overlap command to prevent changing of the PPPM order.
Replacing a fix, but new group != old group
The ID and style of a fix match for a fix you are changing with a fix command, but the new group you are specifying does not match the old group.
Replicating in a non-periodic dimension
The parameters for a replicate command will cause a non-periodic dimension to be replicated; this may cause unwanted behavior.
Resetting reneighboring criteria during PRD
A PRD simulation requires that neigh_modify settings be delay = 0, every = 1, check = yes. Since these settings were not in place, LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC changed them and will restore them to their original values after the PRD simulation.
Resetting reneighboring criteria during TAD
A TAD simulation requires that neigh_modify settings be delay = 0, every = 1, check = yes. Since these settings were not in place, LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC changed them and will restore them to their original values after the PRD simulation.
Resetting reneighboring criteria during minimization
Minimization requires that neigh_modify settings be delay = 0, every = 1, check = yes. Since these settings were not in place, LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC changed them and will restore them to their original values after the minimization.
Restart file used different # of processors
The restart file was written out by a LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC simulation running on a different number of processors. Due to round-off, the trajectories of your restarted simulation may diverge a little more quickly than if you ran on the same # of processors.
Restart file used different 3d processor grid
The restart file was written out by a LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC simulation running on a different 3d grid of processors. Due to round-off, the trajectories of your restarted simulation may diverge a little more quickly than if you ran on the same # of processors.
Restart file used different boundary settings, using restart file values
Your input script cannot change these restart file settings.
Restart file used different newton bond setting, using restart file value
The restart file value will override the setting in the input script.
Restart file used different newton pair setting, using input script value
The input script value will override the setting in the restart file.

This may cause problems when reading the restart file.
Restrain problem: %d %ld %d %d %d %d
Conformation of the 4 listed dihedral atoms is extreme; you may want to check your simulation geometry.
Running PRD with only one replica
This is allowed, but you will get no parallel speed-up.
SRD bin shifting turned on due to small lamda
This is done to try to preserve accuracy.
SRD bin size for fix srd differs from user request
Fix SRD had to adjust the bin size to fit the simulation box. See the cubic keyword if you want this message to be an error vs warning.
SRD bins for fix srd are not cubic enough
The bin shape is not within tolerance of cubic. See the cubic keyword if you want this message to be an error vs warning.
SRD particle %d started inside big particle %d on step %ld bounce %d
See the inside keyword if you want this message to be an error vs warning.
Shake determinant < 0.0
The determinant of the quadratic equation being solved for a single cluster specified by the fix shake command is numerically suspect. LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC will set it to 0.0 and continue.
Should not allow rigid bodies to bounce off relecting walls
LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC allows this, but their dynamics are not computed correctly.
System is not charge neutral, net charge = %g
The total charge on all atoms on the system is not 0.0, which is not valid for the long-range Coulombic solvers.
Table inner cutoff >= outer cutoff
You specified an inner cutoff for a Coulombic table that is longer than the global cutoff. Probably not what you wanted.
Temperature for MSST is not for group all
User-assigned temperature to MSST fix does not compute temperature for all atoms. Since MSST computes a global pressure, the kinetic energy contribution from the temperature is assumed to also be for all atoms. Thus the pressure used by MSST could be inaccurate.
Temperature for NPT is not for group all
User-assigned temperature to NPT fix does not compute temperature for all atoms. Since NPT computes a global pressure, the kinetic energy contribution from the temperature is assumed to also be for all atoms. Thus the pressure used by NPT could be inaccurate.
Temperature for fix modify is not for group all
The temperature compute is being used with a pressure calculation which does operate on group all, so this may be inconsistent.
Temperature for thermo pressure is not for group all
User-assigned temperature to thermo via the thermo_modify command does not compute temperature for all atoms. Since thermo computes a global pressure, the kinetic energy contribution from the temperature is assumed to also be for all atoms. Thus the pressure printed by thermo could be inaccurate.
Too many common neighbors in CNA %d times
More than the maximum # of neighbors was found multiple times. This was unexpected.
Too many inner timesteps in fix ttm
Self-explanatory.
Too many neighbors in CNA for %d atoms
More than the maximum # of neighbors was found multiple times. This was unexpected.
Triclinic box skew is large
The displacement in a skewed direction is normally required to be less than half the box length in that dimension. E.g. the xy tilt must be between -half and +half of the x box length. You have relaxed the constraint using the box tilt command, but the warning means that a LIGGGHTS(R)-PUBLIC simulation may be inefficient as a result.
Use special bonds = 0,1,1 with bond style fene
Most FENE models need this setting for the special_bonds command.
Use special bonds = 0,1,1 with bond style fene/expand
Most FENE models need this setting for the special_bonds command.
Using compute temp/deform with inconsistent fix deform remap option
Fix nvt/sllod assumes deforming atoms have a velocity profile provided by “remap v” or “remap none” as a fix deform option.
Using compute temp/deform with no fix deform defined
This is probably an error, since it makes little sense to use compute temp/deform in this case.
Using fix srd with box deformation but no SRD thermostat
The deformation will heat the SRD particles so this can be dangerous.

Using pair tail corrections with nonperiodic system
This is probably a bogus thing to do, since tail corrections are computed by integrating the density of a periodic system out to infinity.
